    </table><p>Hydrogen peroxide is an antiseptic and disinfectant agent, historically used for wound cleaning and debridement, mouth rinsing, and in some dermatologic preparations. It is not used as a systemic drug and is not approved for systemic administration in modern therapy due to its rapid breakdown and potential for toxicity.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published studies reporting pharmacokinetic parameters of hydrogen peroxide as a pharmaceutical agent in humans. Due to its use as a topical agent and rapid enzymatic degradation by catalase and peroxidases into water and oxygen, it is not absorbed or systemically bioavailable to a significant extent. The pharmacokinetics in vivo are dominated by local breakdown at the site of application.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
